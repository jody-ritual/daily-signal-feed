    </h3>

    
    <p class="card-summary">I’ve been thinking about the logic many apps use: User subscribes → tries to cancel → suddenly gets 40% off. On the one hand, it improves retention. On the other hand, it teaches users to “threaten cancel” to get the real price. Curious how founders think about this. Is it smart pricing psychology or long-term trust damage? &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; /u/LevonIT [link] &amp;#32; [comments]</p>
