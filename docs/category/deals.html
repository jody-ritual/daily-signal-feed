    </h3>

    
    <p class="card-summary">Something I’ve noticed while talking to other founders: When customers report problems, it usually comes in messy.

When we started we didn&#39;t really have a clear product so no contract was written up, however, i currently live in a state with informal partnership protections. His contribution was a low cash stipend to help me pay bills while I built the product out, and I&#39;ve put in close to 15 hours a day 7 days a week for the past 8...</p>
