    </h3>

    
    <p class="card-summary">Is it more important to curate a network of people in your ICP or in the tech world? Context: My startup caters to lawyers. The law world is inherently referral driven, and I was planning to move physically where a high volume of lawyers are, becoming established in the legal tech space and riding the network effect. (this wasn&#39;t the primary reason; mostly deciding between south LA and SF) Then I...</p>

    </h3>

    
    <p class="card-summary">When I first started building, I thought product was everything. If it’s good, people will come. That sounds so naive now. You can build something solid and still hear crickets. Meanwhile average products with strong distribution grow. I don’t even think this is controversial anymore, but I definitely learned it the hard way. When did it click for you that distribution was the real game? &amp;#32...</p>

    <p class="card-summary">Feels like 90% of the advice out there is about acquisition: ads, SEO, cold outreach... But nobody talks about what happens after. Do you have anything in place to keep customers? A process, a tool, even just a habit? Or is it all going into growth and hoping people stick around? &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; /u/Extra-Motor-8227 [link] &amp;#32; [comments]</p>
